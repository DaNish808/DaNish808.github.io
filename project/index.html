                        A towel, [The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy] says, is about the most massively useful thing 
                        an interstellar hitchhiker can have. Partly it has great practical value. You can wrap it around 
                        you for warmth as you bound across the cold moons of Jaglan Beta; you can lie on it on the 
                        brilliant marble-sanded beaches of Santraginus V, inhaling the heady sea vapors; you can sleep 
                        under it beneath the stars which shine so redly on the desert world of Kakrafoon; use it to sail 
                        a miniraft down the slow heavy River Moth; wet it for use in hand-to-hand-combat; wrap it round 
                        your head to ward off noxious fumes or avoid the gaze of the Ravenous Bugblatter Beast of Traal 
                        (such a mind-boggingly stupid animal, it assumes that if you can't see it, it can't see you); 
                        you can wave your towel in emergencies as a distress signal, and of course dry yourself off with 
                        it if it still seems to be clean enough.
